| 90 | 55 | 60 | 82 | 95 |

**Superpower: The Zlatan**
*"Ego override — declare your total stat value is 99 regardless of what's actually on the card. If the opponent's total for that stat is genuinely higher, your bluff fails and you auto-lose. Zlatan doesn't bluff. Zlatan states facts."*

|---------|-------------|---------|--------|-------|
| 92 | 35 | 10 | 78 | 92 |

Position: Defender | Suit: ♥ | Rank: 10

| Tekkers | Shithousery | Madness | Clutch | Vibes |
|---------|-------------|---------|--------|-------|
| 85 | 15 | 8 | 88 | 78 |

**Superpower: Positioning**
*"If you didn't need to tackle, you don't need to play a stat — auto-draw this round. If you were already winning, it becomes a win instead."*

|---------|-------------|---------|--------|-------|
| 92 | 20 | 70 | 65 | 88 |

**Superpower: Crooked Genius**

---

**6 — René Higuita**
*"The scorpion kick. Also once got arrested while being a goalkeeper."*
Position: Goalkeeper | Suit: ♥ | Rank: 6

| Tekkers | Shithousery | Madness | Clutch | Vibes |
|---------|-------------|---------|--------|-------|
| 62 | 55 | 92 | 35 | 88 |

**Superpower: Scorpion Kick**

---

**5 — Carlos Valderrama**
*"The hair. THE HAIR. Also quite good at passing."*
Position: Midfielder | Suit: ♥ | Rank: 5

|---------|-------------|---------|--------|-------|
| 78 | 25 | 45 | 55 | 92 |

| 90 | 78 | 55 | 80 | 72 |

**Superpower: The Face Dive**
*"Ball hits your knee, you grab your face — if you're losing by 10 or less, Shithousery becomes 99 and you win. If the gap is bigger, the ref has seen it. Yellow card, opponent gets +10."*

|---------|-------------|---------|--------|-------|
| 55 | 95 | 72 | 68 | 58 |

**Superpower: The Whisper**
*"Say something unforgivable — opponent's Madness doubles, but becomes uncontrollable. Random stat is used instead of the one they chose. They lost their head. That was the plan."*

---

Position: Midfielder | Suit: ♦ | Rank: 12

|---------|-------------|---------|--------|-------|
| 82 | 15 | 65 | 55 | 95 |

|---------|-------------|---------|--------|-------|
| 55 | 72 | 85 | 65 | 78 |

*"Der Bomber. 365 goals in 427 games. Not flashy. Just lethal."*
Position: Forward | Suit: ♦ | Rank: 10

|---------|-------------|---------|--------|-------|
| 78 | 8 | 12 | 95 | 55 |

Position: Forward | Suit: ♦ | Rank: 9

| Tekkers | Shithousery | Madness | Clutch | Vibes |
|---------|-------------|---------|--------|-------|
| 75 | 65 | 40 | 72 | 82 |

**Superpower: The Dive Celebration**
*"If you win, celebrate with a dive — gain +5 bonus for next round too (lingering momentum). If you lose, the dive is just a dive. Pathetic."*

---

| 55 | 72 | 88 | 60 | 45 |

**Superpower: The Chest Kick**
*"Flying karate kick — Madness becomes 99 AND opponent's card is 'winded' (all their stats –10 next round). How this wasn't a red card remains the great mystery."*

---

*"The Butcher of Bilbao. Broke Maradona's ankle. Kept the boot as a trophy."*

| 45 | 85 | 90 | 55 | 42 |
